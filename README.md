**Bridging the poses of humans and tetrapods with one general model.**

## Capabilities

- **Pose estimation**: Unipose can estimate the pose of any tetrapod with high accuracy.
- **Pose tracking**: Unipose can track the pose of any tetrapod in a video sequence. (TODO)
- **Animal Classification**: Unipose can classify the species of any tetrapod based on its pose. (TODO)

## Features

- **Generalized model**: Unipose is a generalized model that can be applied to any tetrapod species.
- **Code quality**: Unipose utilizes a modern python development toolchain using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging, [black](https://black.vercel.app/) for code style enforcement, [pytest](https://pytest.org/) for automated testing and [pydoctor](https://pydoctor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for documentation.
